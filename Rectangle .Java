 @title:design a class named
  Rectangle to represent a rectangle. The class contains:
  - Two double data fields named width and height that specify the width and
    height of the rectangle. The default values are 1 for both width and height.
  - A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle.
  - A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height.
  - A method named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle.
  - A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.
  Write a test program that creates two Rectangle objects, one with width 4
  and height 40 and the other with width 3.5 and height 35.9. Display the
  width, height, area, and perimeter of each rectangle in this order.
